Have you been uninspired?

This app is designed to find local art galleries from any GPS enabled device. 
The user must first choose the radius that they are willing to travel, 
then the page displays the results of nearby locations to check out.

Then the user would select a google marker to view the name of the gallery they chose, an address and website if they have one. 
This information is displayed in the block on the right hand side of the screen.

The app also provides useful links to external websites that provide extra inspiration, 
in case the user isn't happy with what they found with the map search.

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
